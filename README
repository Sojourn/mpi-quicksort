How to make (compile) our program:

	++======================++
	||	type "make"	||
	++======================++

How to run the our program:

	++==============================++
	||	type "make run"		||
	++==============================++

	Alternatively, you can type
		" mpirun -np 16 qsort input.txt"	(for 16 processors, with input file input.txt)

Feel free to go into to Makefile and edit any of the settings at the top.
The ones you will most likely be interested in are:
	$(INPUTFILE):	The name of the input file (our default is input.txt)
	$(NP):		The number of processors you want to run it on. (Our default is 16 because that is optimal)

At the bottom of the makefile, you see an extra target (gen) and quick instructions on how to use it.
This is simply for generating an input file.  Feel free to use it, instructions are in the Makefile.
